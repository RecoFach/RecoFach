# RecoFach

The faculty of the computer science offers a wide range of subjects, that a student can choose.
Over the last years the amount of subjects rised, due to new institutes, making it harder to get an overview.
RecoFach aims to change it! 

We propose a simple application where students can choose subjects based on the fields of interests.
